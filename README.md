# React Reps

## Learning Goals

For this mini-project I had the following goals:

1. Deploy to Netlify
2. Learn to write basic serverless functions
3. Become more aquainted with TypeScript

I accomplished the first two but hit a wall on the third. Due to time constraints I set aside the third to meet a self imposed deadline.

## Next Steps

I would like to add some additional features and see about implementing TS. The next features I would like to add:

1. Dark Mode
2. Animations

I haven't had a chance to do much with themes and implementing a dark mode seems like a good way to do that.

I was thinking about adding transitions to how reps load in i.e. maybe slow them down a bit and have them appear to roll in.
